Not all CCModules options are themed as well (Mail didn't work for me, but I left it in case it works for someone else).\r\n\r\nI have only tested this on my iPhone X on iOS 11.3.1. I expect it'll work on Plus devices as well, but not the others.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly just swamped with university work, so for the non-Plus/X devices, I apologize.\r\n\r\n<b>!!!THIS PART IS IMPORTANT!!!</b>\r\n\r\nThe wifi and Bluetooth icons are themed using BetterCCIconsPro. I've included both files inside the theme folder, so you guys need to move them (just the images, not the entire folder) to /Library/PreferenceBundles/BetterCCIcons.bundle and then enable glyph mode (experimental) in the settings\r\n\r\nAs a last note, although this is free, donations are very welcome. I've spent a lot of effort and invested time into this for everyone. I hope it's to your liking!",
